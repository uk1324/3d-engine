Could have a portal to transition to the next stage
Could make it a vortex or maybe make everything turn black or white. A circle that is in the middle of the portal that expands to cover the whole screen.
Could make the portal attract the player.

Could make a gravity changing orb or a gravity changing by pressing some button.
Moving obsctacles. Could do PBR saws. Could make lightning that appears toggles on and off.
Could make the background a circut.
Could make bullets and explosion effects.

Blocks that switch on and off like celeste b side rooms.

could make the title have a 3d glasses effect

Could add swing orb. The player would swing on the nearest orb. The motion would be restricted to a circle.
The player would connect to the orb using a beam. Could make the orb a different color from the player and then mix the colors in some way.

Movement
All possible movements are curves in space (if there is teleportation then the curves can be disconnected).
What possible trajectories are there?
Parabolic (jump)
Upside down parabolic (geometry dash green orb)
Straight line (dash, cannon, geometry dash black orb)
Jump then gravity reverse (geometry dash blue orb)
Pursuit curve
Spiral (spring force)
Movement while being attached to a shape (roulletes for example cycloid)
Gravity in different metrics
Rolling on a half circle then moving up
Sliding off a ramp
Mid air gravity 

Flying
Minecraft creative mode
Super mario world cape boosts
Celeste feather

The velocity also matters. A dash will be instantenous, but a cannot might have a delay letting you aim.
Fast fall (ground pound)
Slow fall (super mario world cape)

Combos for example super mario 64 jumps

Changing hitbox
Crouch

Interacting with world
Ground pound destroys blocks (super mario)
Dash activates moving platforms (celeste)
