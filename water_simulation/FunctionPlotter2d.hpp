// Could make a little axis in some corner that moves with the camera. The axis would have text with the names on them. Could use 2d to render it. One issue is that the text would overlap in the wrong order with the axes.

// For movement could allow rotating the camera up and down and around the forward axis maybe using the mouse idk. Could maybe allow rotating the surface instead of the camera.

// To move the camera the window would need to be focused. Then pressing escape could unfocus the window.
