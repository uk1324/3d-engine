Not sure how to correctly plot implicit functions like xy = 0. This graph looks like an 'x' in the middle. The issue is that this is a inbetween case between hyperbolas with arms in different directions. There is a single 'x' case and infinitely many hyperbolic cases. 
Marching squares only inspects 4 values around a point and based on that determines what lines to place in the case of xy = 0 it would be:
<0 | >0
-------
>0 | <0
So it predicts a saddle point.

Another algorithm that could be used would be computing the intersection of a plane z = 0 with the mesh of z = 0 with xy = 0. Because it just linearly interpolates between values this probably wouldn't work any better than marching squares.

To detect this kind of point you could show that the arms are connected in the middle. One way to do this might be rootfinding (maybe idk). Then 4 lines instead of 2 would be added and interpolated in the marching squares algorithm.
