6.5.1
One way to find the conserved quantity is to try to separate the variables.

6.5.2
x'' = x - x^2
c)
The homoclinic orbits have to contain the fixed point so to find them just calculate the conserved quantity and set plug in the fixed point to get the constant.

The dynamics of a equation. Notice that f only depends on x.
x'' = f(x) 
Always have a jacobian of the form
[ 0     1 ] 
[ df/dx 0 ]
So the only possible dynamics of fixed points are
df/dx > 0 => Saddle point
df/dx < 0 => Center
df/dx == 0 => Line of fixed points. The dynamics only depend on the velocity.

Moddeling an exchange of some quantity between set scould be done by doing something like this
dx/dt = -f(x, y)
dy/dt = f(x, y)

6.5.7 
c) To verify that a linearized center corresponds to a nonlinear center you can calculate the conserved quantity and check if the curve is closed. In the case of a conserved system by Theorem 6.5.1 then orbit has to be closed.
d) Plug in the equalibrium point to the conserved quantity. Probably haven't checked.

6.5.10
x' = y
y' = (h^2)/(x^3)-k/(x^2)
0 = y^2/2+h^2/2x^2-k/x-c
0 = h^2/2x^2-k/x-y // Potential
Because of the uniquness you you find one solution that bounds them then that should be enough
The solutions are symmetric around the y axis.
Based on the potential you can find the minimum of the energy surface. It is sufficient to just look at the slice the potential (the slice with y = 0), because the energy increases with y. The lower bound of the energy is the minimum of the potential and the upper bound is the asymptote of the potential.
If there y is in this range then there are 2 intersections and everything between them has lower energy. The trajectories are closed by by Theorem 6.5.1 because the system is conservative.
Also r can't be negative, because it represents distance.

6.5.11
The equations are not separable. The thing that divides the basins is the stable manifold of the saddle point.
Based on the initial velocity the system can oscilate back and forth multiple times before choosing where it ends up. So the basins for 2 intertwining spirals.

TODO: 6.5.12 Could add x' = xy y'=-x^2

6.5.13
The conserved quantity is symmetric around the x and y axes and it increases when it gets further away from the fixed point.

6.5.14
a) Calculate the derivative of the quantity and everything will cancel.
The nullclines are
v' = 0 => theta = 0. This means that with no grag flying parallel to the ground the velocity won't change. The angle can still be changed by the other equation.
theta' = 0 => v^2 = cos(theta)

You can plot 3d system as 2d plots with color representing the other variable. You could for example have damping by transfered into heat energy.


TODO:
Also poincare recurrence theorem
The Hopf decomposition states that every measure space with a non-singular transformation can be decomposed into an invariant conservative set and a wandering (dissipative) set. A commonplace informal example of Hopf decomposition is the mixing of two liquids (some textbooks mention rum and coke): The initial state, where the two liquids are not yet mixed, can never recur again after mixing; it is part of the dissipative set. Likewise any of the partially-mixed states. The result, after mixing (a cuba libre, in the canonical example), is stable, and forms the conservative set; further mixing does not alter it. I

For any solution [x(t), y(t)] you have
f(x(t), y(t)) = C
f_x dx/dt + f_y dy/dt = 0
f_x dx/dt = -f_y dy/dt
f_x dx= -f_y dy
S(f_x)dx= -S(f_y)dy

What is the relation between conservative vector fields and conserved quantites.

6.5.14 is an example of a non separable conservative system.

separable => conservative, but I don't think the implication the other way applies.
From this we also get, not conservative => not separable.
If a system is conservative then you can think of it as isoheights of a surface. If you have a system like a spiral. For example x' = y; y' = -x - y. Then I don't think you can create such a surface for it to satisfy some algebraic expression.

From a conserved quantity you can derive the form of the differential equations satisfying it. For example
x^2 + y^2 = C
d(x^2 + y^2)/dx = 0
2x + 2y dy/dx = 0
2x = -2y dy/dx
2x dx = -2y dy
2x dx/dt = -2y dy/dt
dx/dt = -y/x dy/dt
The if dy/dt = -x^2 then dx/dt = y/x * x^2 = xy. This is the system from exercise 6.5.12
If dy/dt = x^3 then dx/dt = -y/x * x^3 = -yx^2

EXAMPLE 6.5.1:
Show that a conservative system cannot have any attracting fixed points
